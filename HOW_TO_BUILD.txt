Prerequisites:
- Visual Studio 2022 Community Edition
- Strawberry perl portable edition installed in c:\perl
- Cygwin (with the following packages: bison, flex, gawk, gperf, gzip, nasm, sed, python27, python38, python38-lxml)
- Python39 with lxml and mako
- To build the installer: nsis

or make it easy on yourself and use the new Docker-based build environment:

Run buildDocker.cmd and give it a couple hours to build the build environment.
From inside the VcXSrv source directory, launch the build environment using

		runDocker.cmd

When the container is up, run the following to clone the source into the container and enter the Cygwin build environment:

		git clone src vcx
		cygwin
		cd /cygdrive/c/vcx

Now you can build a 64-bit Debug build on an 8-core system...

		./buildall.cmd 1 9 D

buildall.sh <32/64-bit flag> <build tasks> <Debug/Release flag> [Build deps flag]

Where:
  - 32/64-bit flag - 1=64-bit, 0=32-bit
  - build tasks is the number of parallel build tasks to run (use cpu count + 1)
  - Debug/Release flag - D=Debug, R=Release, A=All
  - optional Build deps flag - N=Only build the server

And then copy the installer back with:

    ./copyRelease.sh
